\abstract{Several theories beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of new heavy particles decaying into pairs of gauge bosons. In this proceedings the latest ATLAS results on searches for resonances decaying into pairs of $W$ or $Z$ bosons or photon  based on datasets of 36  and 80 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data collected at 13 TeV will be discussed.

\section{Introduction}

The discovery of a Higgs-like particle announced by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in 2012 \cite{HIGG-2012-27} has been an important milestone in the understanding of the mechanism of electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking. %[3-5].

Next step is to figure out whether this particle is the only one or if it is part of an extended Higgs sector as predicted by several extensions of the Standard Model (SM): composite Higgs models, heavy vector triplets and models with warped extra dimensions
%Diboson vector and tensor resonances are also predicted in several other extensions to the SM, such as in composite Higgs mod- els [9, 10] and models with warped extra dimensions [11?14].


In these proceedings a collection of different results is presented.
A search for additional heavy resonances in diboson final states presented for several channels: leptonic decays of $W$ and $Z$ bosons pairs described in Section~\ref{sec:WW} and \ref{sec:ZZ} for 36fb$^{-1}$; fully hadronic decays of $VV$ described in Section~\ref{sec:VV} using 80 fb$^{-1}$ dataset; photon and hadronicaly decaying $Z,W$ or $H$ bosons .
