\abstract{Several theories beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of new heavy particles decaying into pairs of gauge bosons. In this presentation the latest ATLAS results on searches for resonances decaying into pairs of W or Z bosons or photons, or into a Z boson and a photon, based on 36 fb-1 of pp collision data collected at 13 TeV will be discussed.
